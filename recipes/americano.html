    <h2><p><strong>Americanos may be the perfect coffee drink for espresso lovers:</strong> 
        get the rich, bold taste of espresso, with the volume of a pourover.</p></h2>

    <p><strong><H3>What is an Americano?</H3></strong>
        One of the most straightforward coffee 
        drinks you can make, an Americano is simply a shot of espresso (double
        preferrably), diluted with hot water. It gets you all the benefits of 
        an espresso, but more of it!</p>
    
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A suitable amount of coffee for your espresso</li>
            <li>hot water, 6-10 oz, based on preference</li>
        </ul>

    <strong>Recipe</strong>
        <ol><strong>Boil your water</strong>. I prefer to have my water ready before I 
            begin brewing my espresso. Pour your water into your cup, leaving room for
             your espresso shot</ol>
        <ol><strong>Prepare your espresso.</strong> For the purposes of this guide, we will
            leave that decision to the reader. My personal preference is a 
            double shot with a ~20-21g dose, targetting an extraction time of
            40 seconds, with an output of approximately 25 grams</ol>
        <ol>With your cup under the portafilter, <strong>begin brewing your espresso</strong></ol>
        <ol><strong>Stop brewing when your target extraction time is reached.</strong> Ideally,
            your drink will have some nice texture on top when it is done. </ol>
        <ol>Let your drink cool appropriately and enjoy. <strong>Do not stir!</strong></ol>
